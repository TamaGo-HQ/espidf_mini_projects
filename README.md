# My guide on Starting with ESP32

Hello, Bonjour, Î³ÎµÎ¹Î± ÏƒÎ±Ï‚  

This repo is made with the purpose of being a reference, a guide, for anyone starting with ESP32, specifically ESP32 with ESP-IDF, and who wants to follow the journey of a fellow beginner learner.

## Disclaimer  

Iâ€™m not exactly a beginner in embedded software development, nor with ESP32.  

Iâ€™ve worked with Arduino, ESP32, and STM32 before. But my last internship was in a different engineering field (SCADA & HMIs for oil & gas). You could argue itâ€™s not that different (they all come around to monitoring and control when boiled down), but my tasks there were pretty far from the embedded software I usually do (mostly Python). Hence, the motivation for this road trip with the ESP32.

## Why ESP-IDF?  

Because I already worked with the Arduino framework before on an Arduino Uno (my first embedded software experience), and I also used PlatformIO on VS Code to program ESP32. I just wanted to try something tougher.  

So here we are. For this little road trip I bought an **ESP32-WROOM-32D board**, mind you, this is the first board Iâ€™ve ever actually owned. Before, I was always borrowing boards from companies I interned at, robotics clubs, or friends.  

This one has **dual-core, WiFi, Bluetooth, and a CP2104** so I can program it directly from my PCâ€™s USB port.

## Final Notes  

This list is more like a playlist than a roadmap. Iâ€™ll probably change it as I go.  

I might do a project a day, maybe two a day. Honestly, no clue yet.  

So buckle up and enjoy the ride ðŸš€
